## Description
The notebooks are broken into individual machine learning algorithms coded from scratch following the course BIOST 558 material.
The algorithms coded are:
- Ridge Regression with Gradient Descent
- Logistic Regression with Fast Gradient Descent
- Linear Support Vector Machine with Huberdized Hinge Loss
- Principal Component Analysis with Power Iteration Algorithm
- LASSO Regression with Coordinate Descent Algorithm
- Kernel Support Vector Machine with Smooth Hinge Loss
